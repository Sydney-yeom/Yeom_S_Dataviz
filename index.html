                <p class="intro">
                    These are the data analyses of Asian countries' Olympic medals from 1956 to 2014 by using 'OlymicsWinter' data, provided by Professor Joe Kormendi. It is composed of four different analyses; it is how the number of medals is composed by gender, how the portion of the medal count is different between 'before 2000' and 'after 2000', the portion of the medal count by sports with gender, and lastly the portion of the medal number by sports with countries. By the way, Asian countries' athletes started to gain medals from 1956.
